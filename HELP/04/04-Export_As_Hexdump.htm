as hexdump)</DIV><br>
<br>
This command is used if you need the hexdump of the file in plain
text form, for example if you need to insert it in a word
processor document. You can either put the hexdump into the
clipboard or into a file, which you will have to choose. The
start line of the hexdump has to be specified (in hexadecimal
notation without prefix), which you can find on the left side of
the window, for example 23c or 134. You must also specify the end
line. The values in the dialog will be initialized so that the
whole file will be dumped, if there is nothing selected, or they
will be such that the current selection will be dumped.</p>
