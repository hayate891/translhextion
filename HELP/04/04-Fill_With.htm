<br>
First select some of the bytes in a file then open the Fill
selection with dialog from the edit menu or using Ctrl + Shift +
F.<br>
First decide if you want to enter the bytes in yourself - this is
useful for small numbers of bytes and if so select Input from
the combo box and enter the bytes below it.<br>
<br>
Otherwise you may want to fill the selection with a file by
selecting File from the combo box and browsing to a file (It MUST
exist - this is why only browsing is allowed).<br>
<br>
Note that if the selection is larger than the file or the hex
string you entered the selection will be filled with multiple
copies of your string/file and if it is smaller only a part of
the string will be entered into the selection.<br>
Note also that an odd number of hex digits will result in the
first nibble of the last byte being the last hex digit entered.<br>
<br>
e.g. &quot;ffa&quot; &#151;&gt; &quot;ff af fa &#133;&quot;
&#151;&gt; &quot;ÿ¯ú&#133;&quot;<br>
(This doesn&#146;t apply to files as partial bytes cannot be
present in files)<br>
Then select the type of assignment operator you want to use - <br>
<br>
= - regular assign<br>
|= - perform a bitwise or with the current byte and then assign<br>
&amp;= - perform a bitwise and with the current byte and then
assign<br>
^= - perform a bitwise xor with the current byte and then assign<br>
Below are the <br>
