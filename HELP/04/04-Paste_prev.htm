This either inserts or overwrites data starting at the current
offset. Choose a radio button for the writing mode wished for.
The big edit-box is initialised with the current text content of
the clipboard. <u>Since Edit-boxes can not hold very large amounts
of data (around 64K), please use <a href="04-Paste.htm">Selection/Paste</A> to paste such
large blocks of memory</u>. You can also choose how many times the
current data is written.<br>
<br>
If &quot;Paste coded binary values as text&quot; is unchecked,
all data in the edit-box is considered to contain special syntax,
so &lt;ld:150&gt; will not be written as the text &quot;&lt;ld:150&gt;&quot;
but as a longword value of 150. Check the checkbox if you want to
paste as text. The binary mode (Little or Big-endian) and
character set (ANSI or OEM) is used as set in the options.<br>
