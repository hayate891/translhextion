Guidelines:<br>
<br>
I am a student and as such I don't have much free time to be
trying to sort through thousands of e-mails a day. As much as I
would love to hear that my program is being appreciated I simply
cannot have every single user sending me e-mail. With that in
mind, here is what I request:<br>
<br>
<b>You can send me e-mail if:</b><br>
<br>
- You have any comments on Translhextion. Unfortunately, as of version 1.6c, there is no support for any bugs the program may have.<BR>
<br>
- You desire an interview for publication or employment.<br>
<br>
- I know you by name.<br>
<br>
Please send e-mail to me at:<br>
<a href="mailto:bennewit@cs.uiuc.edu">bennewit@cs.uiuc.edu</A><br>
<br>

The final version of the program and source code is hosted at Kitsune Sniper's webpage: http://vice.parodius.com/
