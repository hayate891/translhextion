If you are going to update the program, the help file, the font (Januschan
Jome Regular) and the original license must be included with it. The icon is
owned by Square Soft and the name Januschan is trademarked. Hence, if you
try to make money with this program, Square may take action against you. So
please do not try to do anything of the sort.

Instructions to compile the program and suggestions for improving it are 
included in the source documentation.</PRE><P>
