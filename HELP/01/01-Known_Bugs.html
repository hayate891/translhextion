<br>
- Increasing the number of bytes displayed per line (when automatic is disabled)
beyond 30 causes Translhextion to behave erratically on some systems<br>
- Windows 2000 sometimes won't display the Thingy IME window but you can still
use it even though you can't see it.&nbsp; To fix this, close any open windows
that have &quot;topmost&quot; priority since the IME is system modal<br>
- Trying to insert a script beyond the end of the file is not
currently possible, the script gets truncated at the last byte
whether it is done being inserted or not<br>
- Tables with lines ending in carriage return characters produce bizarre negative effects<br>
- There are a few selection redraw bugs
