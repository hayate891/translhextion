<br>
If there are experts out there who can give me information about
the following topics in a format that I can understand it would
be much appreciated. I will use any information about these
topics to add features to Translhextion. If you are such an
expert, please contact me. <a href="01-Contacting_The_Author.html">(Contacting the Author)</A><br>

<DIV CLASS="italic">I would appreciate a brief lesson on pointer calculation from a
binary perspective (geared towards SNES roms rather than another
kind if it helps). I know what pointers are; I just don't
understand what this feature of Thingy DOES exactly and how I can
implement a similar feature.</DIV><br>
<tt><br>
Pointer calculations<br>
in addition to script insertions, you can insert updated pointer
tables as<br>
well. first, make your insert bookmark and have that all set up.
Next, you<br>
need to add another line in your table file that looks like this:<br>
<br>
&amp;CE804h-200h<br>
<br>
Thingy includes support for two types of pointers: standard
pointers and<br>
relative pointers.<br>
<br>
For standard pointers:<br>
The first address is the beginning location of your table file.
The second<br>
address is the size of the header (For NES games this is 10h, for
SNES games this is 200h.)<br>
<br>
For relative pointers:<br>
Same as standard pointers except make the header size 0.<br></tt>
<DIV CLASS="italic">
I'd like to implement more tile formats and dimensions in Infontile but I need more
documentation on how they are stored.&nbsp; If you have documentation or
knowledge about these formats and are willing to help in
this area I would appreciate it.
<p>
I'd like some information about converting between standard hex
addresses and various types of rom addresses<br>
<br>
If anyone has info about SNES rom expansion and header editing, I
would gladly accept information about that as well.</DIV>
