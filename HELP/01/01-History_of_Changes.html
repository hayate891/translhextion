<DIV class="title">Whats New in 1.6?</DIV>&nbsp;
<p>
- Added the ability to do search for a hex string as an alternative to text
using the standard &quot;Find&quot; command<br>
- Added the option to reset the change color of changed bytes to the default
byte color upon saving the file<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <p>+ This option is now the default though you can change it as desired</p>
</ul>
- Added 2-byte functionality to the ' ^ ' table extension which you can use to highlight
specific bytes in a user-selectable highlight color<br>
<ul>+ Syntax is as follows: ^xx<br>
  + Alternatively, for 2-byte values the syntax is: ^xxxx<br></ul>
<p>- Added the option to view hex
offsets in SNES HiROM and LoROM formats<br>
</p>
<ul>+ When in a SNES hex mode, all hex inputs will be interpreted in that format<br>
<ul>~ This includes boomarks and script dump marks added manually or by tables<BR></ul>
</ul>
<p>
- Removed the need to &quot;activate&quot; Thingy Tables, now they are active
when they are loaded<br>
- Now the ascii for DTE values is displayed in a different, user-selectable color so they are easy to see<br>
- Improved the speed of loading a file<br>
- Changed Automatic Bytes Per Line setting to be turned off when first entering
Thingy View<br>
- Changed &quot;Color Settings&quot; dialog to accommodate new colors<br>
- Fixed the window resizing crashing bug<br>
- Fixed a problem with partial open that incorrectly displayed the number of
changed bytes when saving<br>
- Fixed the problem where highlighting didn't get removed when a new table was
loaded<br>
- A number of aesthetic changes have been made<br>
- The documentation has been updated to reflect new changes</p>
<P>
<HR>
<b>What's New in 1.5?</b></p>
<P>- By request, a new feature called
&quot;Thingy IME&quot; allows you to directly enter dynamically table-encoded text
into a file<br>
<ul>+  Now you don't have to dump a script to a file or to the screen to edit it<br>
+ You can enter text in insert or overwrite modes<br>
+ Text you enter is encoded on the fly as you type it<br>
+ Load and activate a table and press &lt;ENTER&gt; and you're ready to go<br></ul>
- After dumping a Japanese script you will now be given the option to merge
punctuation characters with the characters they modify which produces a more
Thingy-like script<br>
- By request, added the ability to hide/show the hex pane for easy script
viewing<br>
<ul>+ This mode does not allow editing<br></ul>
- Now any bytes that get changed are displayed in a different, user-selectable
color so they are easy to see<br>
- Extended Thingy Table functionality with ' ^ ' which you can use to highlight
specific bytes in a user-selectable highlight color<br>
<ul>+ Syntax is as follows: ^xx<br></ul>
- Changed &quot;Color Settings&quot; dialog to accommodate new colors<br>
- Fixed a majority of the selection color bugs<br>
<ul>+ Selected text color now works as it should<br></ul>
- Translhextion will now attempt to automatically install the included Japanese font when it
runs for the first time<br>
- A number of aesthetic changes have been made<br>
- The documentation has not only been updated but is now in HTML Help format
thanks to Kitsune Sniper

<b>What's New in 1.4?<br>
</b>
<br>
NOTE: <i>The included font must be installed in the system font directory (usually</i> C:\WINDOWS\FONTS
 or C:\WINNT\FONTS<i>) for most of the new features to work.</i><P>

- Added a custom-made Japanese font which displays Hiragana and Katakana characters in "Thingy view"<br>
<ul>+ both Shift-JIS and EUC-JIS table files are supported by this feature<br>
+ single Japanese characters (2 bytes) or pairs of Japanese characters (4 bytes) will display correctly<br></ul>
- Added table conversion between Shift-JIS and EUC-JIS<br>
<ul>+  tables can also be converted to and from Romaji but there are some bugs here still<br>
+ the loaded table is dynamically converted, saved, and reloaded so backup your table files<br></ul>
- Changed the behavior of the "Copy" command when "Thingy view"
 is enabled to copy the script data to the clipboard instead of the ascii data
<br>
<ul>+ new line characters don't seem to paste correctly in notepad and
  other windows programs though it looks fine when saved and viewed in DOS edit<br></ul>
<br>
- Added speed hack that speeds up non-japanese script manipulations
<br>
<ul>+  automatically assumes ">" if no ! or @ characters are indicated which avoids unnecessary punctuation-movement calculation<br></ul>
- Fixed a major bug where "Save" didn't work at all though "Save as" worked fine<br>
- Fixed a crash bug that occurred when scrolling down to last byte when in "Thingy view"<br>
- Fixed a bug in Value Scan Relative that caused it to stop working after searching once and then changing the search string<br>
- A number of aesthetic changes have been made<br>
- The documentation has been updated<br>
<P>
<HR>
<!-- 1.2       -->
<b>What's New in 1.3?</b><br>
<br>
- Changed script output format<br>
<ul>+ When separated-byte format is disabled, the output no longer
has MTE &amp; multi-byte values enclosed yielding a much cleaner
script (only numeric &amp; unknown values are enclosed)<br>
+ A second newline is output after an endstring token yielding a
slightly cleaner script<br>
+ These features break backwards compatibility with previously
dumped scripts so don't replace a script dumped with an older
version with this version<br>
+ This also means that you need to manually enter two newlines
after an endstring token when writing scripts now<br></ul>
- Removed &quot;Normal Compression&quot; from the script
optimization feature which now uses maximum compression all the
time to achieve the best results (averages about a 40% reduction
in # of bytes from a non-byte-separated script)<br>
- Added progress bars in many places<br>
<ul>+ Now you will KNOW it isn't frozen during dumps/replacements/optimizations
&amp; relative searches<br></ul>
<br>
- Added a new feature called &quot;Value Scan Relative&quot;
which is actually a modified version of the original (1.0)
relative search engine which can be used to search using non-western
alphabets (which the new engine cannot do)<br>
<ul>+ The new feature allows you to search the whole file using a
sequence of decimal, hex, or character values<br>
+ It allows you to have byte-wildcards<br>
+ You can save the same data about the results to a file<br>
+ Use &quot;Search Relative&quot; &amp; &quot;Scan Relative&quot;
for finding western-alphabet (arabic) strings containing a
mixture of [A-Z] [a-z] [1-9] because it searches using the
relationships in the arabic alphabet<br>
+ Use &quot;Value Scan Relative&quot; to find relative results
based on offsets (which is why you shouldn't mix case with this
engine for the arabic alphabet at least) in any alphabet<br></ul>
- Added the ability to select a certain number of bytes to &quot;Select
Block&quot; in addition to the existing offset range selection<br>
- Add/Remove/Clear bookmarks now all save changes to the loaded
table<br>
- Added ability to enable clean dumping (#), &amp; change the
status of punctuation movement (&gt;) to the Table Toolbar<br>
<ul>+ Changes are saved to the loaded table<br></ul>
- Implemented another speed hack in the dumper which is a
significant speed increase for large scripts<br>
- Fixed a bug in the table-handling code which caused certain
tokens not to load<br>
- Fixed a bug in the script-dump-bookmark feature that made only
one of the bookmarks work at a time<br>
- A number of aesthetic changes have been made<br>
- The documentation has been updated<br>
<P>
<HR>
<!-- 1.2       -->
<b>What's New in 1.2?</b><br>
<br>
<b>Thingy table compatibility enhanced dramatically:</b><br>
<br>
- Linked values ( $xx=## ) have been implemented and tested up to
value 99
<ul>+ you can have as many as you want</ul>
- Japanese punctuation movement has been implemented in the style
of Thingy<br>
<ul>+ now !xx, @xx, and &gt; are all supported within tables<br>
+ punctuation movement is supported in both the dumper &amp; the
reinserter<br>
<ul>~ if it was switched during a dump it will be switched back
during a replace</ul>
+ much thanks to Necrosaro &amp; Naflign for walking me through
this</ul>
- Now # is supported as well for dumping truly clean scripts!<br>
- Thingy-view is now nearly identical to the way Thingy views
files<br>
<br>
<b>The table-handling code has been tweaked resulting in the
following features:</b><br>
- 2 &amp; 3-byte values are now supported unlike when I said they
were but they really weren't<br>
<ul>+ this includes the endstring &amp; newline tokens<br>
+ this has been tested this time<br>
+ it has NOT been tested on Dakuten/Handakuten values though they
should work too<br></ul>

- Translhextion shouldn't crash anymore if a file is opened as a
table and is not a table<br>
- Bookmarks added during program operation are now automatically
saved to the loaded table file if a table file is loaded<br>
- A new encoding option has been added to the &quot;Optimize
Script&quot; function<br>
<ul>+ choose between normal (old-style) or maximum compression (new!)<br>
<ul>~ normal compression still just optimizes a script using DTE only<br>
~ maximum compression will optimize a script using DTE, MTE,
&amp; multi-byte values!!!!!!<br>
<ul>- unfortunately, this can be slow at times<br></ul></ul>
~ maximum compression can be used to make a &quot;clean-dumped&quot;
script (#) reinsertable<br>
<ul>- (except of course for any numeric values that got stripped)<br></ul></ul>
- Fixed a large number of table-loading bugs which were the cause
of frustration for many<br>
<ul>+ if you're table has a carriage return at the end of each line
you will still have problems<br></ul>
- Fixed a bug in the dumper which probably never affected anyone
but you never know
<br>
- Added another speed-hack in the dumper/reinserter which yields
more speed Yay! (not very dramatic this time)<br>
<br>
<b>The following has also been changed:</b><br>
- A new feature called &quot;Relative Scan&quot; has been
implemented<br>
<ul>+ the old style of saving relative search results to a file has
been removed<br>
+ now relative search is just for finding and selecting values<br>
+ relative scan will relative search the whole document<br>
<ul>~ you can view the offsets, &amp; relative offsets of the search
immediately<BR>
~ you can then choose to save the results to a file<br>
~ you can also generate a skeletal Thingy table from the relative
offsets of a found sequence</ul>
<br></ul>
- A new feature has been added which notifies you before saving
if the file's size has changed<br>
<ul>+ it tells you by how many bytes the file has changed +/-</ul><br>
- A number of small bugs have been fixed here and there
especially in the relative search algorithm<br>
- A number of aesthetic changes have been made<br>
- The documentation has been updated<br>
<br>

<!-- 1.1  -->
<HR>

<b>What's New in 1.1</b><br>
<br>
<b>The table-handling code has been re-engineered resulting in the
following features:</b><br>
- Script dumping/replacing/optimizing is MUCH MUCH FASTER!!!! We're
talking multiple orders of magnitude here<br>
- Option to view file as literal ascii OR as equivalent table
values (in the style of Thingy &amp; Thingy32) thanks to table
speed increase<br>
- Table values can be up to 3-bytes (though only 2-byte values
have been thoroughly tested) except for newline and endstring
values which can be up to 2-bytes<br>
<br>
- &quot;Table Active&quot; has been moved to a floating tool bar
along with the Thingy-style view option<br>
<br>
<b>The search relative code has been rewritten to be much more
versatile:</b><br>
- It is no longer limited to search strings of a single case<br>
- It is no longer limited to ONLY alphabetic OR numeric search
strings<br>
- Any of the following characters may be used in any combination
in a search string [A - Z], <br>
[a - z], and [1 - 9]. Any other character is treated as a byte-wildcard!<br>
<br>
- An option has been added to search the remainder of the open
file and save the results to a separate file with all sorts of
useful information a la SearchR<br>
- Unfortunately this makes the relative searching process slower
: (<br>
<br>
<b>The following has also been changed:</b><br>
- An Intelligent Right-Click menu has been added which allows the
following operations only when appropriate:
<ul>+ Cut<br>
+ Copy<br>
+ Paste<br>
+ Paste preview<br>
+ Dump Script<br>
+ Replace Script<br>
+ Hexdump<br>
+ Jump to<br>
+ Select All<br></ul>
- The documentation has been updated<br>
- Other numerous small bugs have been fixed
