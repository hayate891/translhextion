<b>Q</b>: Why does Translhextion freeze up when I dump/replace/optimize
large scripts?<br>
<br>
<b>A</b>: It doesn't really freeze!! Task Manager may say &quot;Not
responding&quot; but unless Translhextion actually crashed
violently it hasn't stopped ticking. Any operation that uses the
table heavily can be VERY time consuming depending on your
machine and the size of the scripts. One of the features I plan
to add soon is a progress indicator for these operations so that
the program doesn't appear to be frozen. The best solution for
the time being is just to wait :)<br>

<b>Q</b>: Why does Translhextion freeze up when I perform a relative
search?<br>
<br>
<b>A</b>: It doesn't really freeze!! Task Manager may say &quot;Not
responding&quot; but unless Translhextion actually crashed
violently it hasn't stopped ticking. Search relative uses a
complex algorithm to ensure accuracy and so it can take some time.
