Special Thanks to: <br>
<br>
<b>Necrosaro</b> - The creator of the original Thingy. I could never get
Thingy to work for me so I was inspired to write my own. I
actually started out by looking at Thingy's source code but I
didn't get very far because it was a little messy. But there is
still a big thanks for pioneering this wonderful idea. In
addition, thanks is due for detailed explanations about Thingy's
functionality.<br>
<br>
<b>Raihan Kibria</b> - (<a href="mailto:rkibria@hrz1.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de">rkibria@hrz1.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de</a>) I used many of
his dialog resources in Translhextion as well as his original
byte-code syntax and Template features. He was one of the primary
inspirations behind this project. <br>

<br>
<b>Richard Bush</b> - The creator of SearchR2, a relative search engine.
This program was the first time I'd ever heard of &quot;relative
search&quot; and so, even though I am implementing it very
differently, big thanks here.<br>
<br>
<b>CecilE2233</b> - This is the person who got me started on emulation
way back in 1996. Though I am probably not remembered, I will
never forget. I can't thank them enough though. <br>
<br>
<b>Zophar</b> - The mind behind the incredible &quot;Zophar's Domain&quot;
<a href="http://www.zophar.net">(http://www.zophar.net)</a> which has been my mecca since it began in
1997. <br>
<br>
<b>Naflign</b> - Thanks goes out to Naflign for walking me through a
tutorial on Japanese punctuation and for testing a number of different features for me.<br>
<br>
<b>Kitsune Sniper [David Silva Garc&iacute;a]</b> - (<a href="mailto:kitsune@terra.com">kitsune@terra.com</a>) 
The HTML engineer of this help file who generously offered to rewrite my documentation in HTML by hand.  Thanks goes to Kitsune for making this help file a work of art.<br>(<a href="http://vice.parodius.com">http://vice.parodius.com</a>)<br>
<br>
<b>ABBA</b> - I coded Translhextion in its entirety while listening to the ABBA
Gold CD.&nbsp; Without them you wouldn't be reading this : )<P>
<br>
And many other people who will be listed here when I think of
them...</p>
