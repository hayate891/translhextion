<br>
Use this command to apply a binary template on the file. A binary
template consists of a text file with the extension &quot;tpl&quot;
that contains a number of variable type+name combinations, such
as this:<br>
<br>
<tt>BYTE filetype<br>
WORD version<br>
DWORD filelength<br></tt>
<br>
This sample template file named &quot;sample.tpl&quot; is
included in the Translhextion directory. When the command is
chosen from the menu you will be prompted to choose the template
file you want to apply. Translhextion will then load that file
and use the code in it to give you a structured &quot;interpretation&quot;
of the data in the currently loaded file, starting at the current
byte. The result will be displayed in the edit-box of a dialogue,
from where you can copy the result to the clipboard if necessary.
The result looks like this:<br>
<br>
<tt>File: C:\Data\test.dat<br>
Template file: C:\Translhextion\sample.tpl<br>
Applied at offset: 15</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>BYTE filetype = 66 (signed) = 66 (unsigned) = 0x42 = 'B'<br>
WORD version = 30285 (signed) = 30285 (unsigned) = 0x764d<br>
DWORD filelength = 8 (signed) = 8 (unsigned) = 0x8</tt><br>
<br>
-&gt; Length of template = 7 bytes.<br>
<br>
Following variable types are recognized: (recognition is case-sensitive,
so &quot;byte&quot; is not recognized as type &quot;BYTE&quot;)<br>
- a byte-size value: &quot;BYTE&quot;, &quot;char&quot;.<br>
- a word-size value: &quot;WORD&quot;, &quot;short&quot;.<br>
- a longword-size value: &quot;DWORD&quot;, &quot;int&quot;,
&quot;long&quot;, &quot;LONG&quot;.<br>
- a float value: &quot;float&quot;.<br>
- a double value: &quot;double&quot;.<br>
The File/Open in text editor command:<br>
This function attempts to call an external text editing program
with the current file as argument. Default editor is the Windows
Notepad. You can choose the editor in the Options/Preferences...
dialogue.<br>
