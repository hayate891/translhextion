<br>
If you want to edit a very large file and it's not necessary to
load all of it into memory, choose this command. First you will
have to choose the file you want to open in a File-Open-dialog.
Then you must enter the offset from which the file will be loaded
and how many bytes to load, or you can check the &quot;Open
partially from end of file&quot;-radio button if you want to load
data from the end of the file. <P>Translhextion will now be in
partially-opened-mode, which means that whenever you choose the
<a href="03-Save.htm">File/Save</A>, the data will be written back to the position they
were loaded from. This mode is indicated by a letter &quot;P&quot;
in the window title after the file name.</p>
