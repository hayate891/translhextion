<br>
If Translhextion is started with command line parameters, then
the whole string following the program name is considered to be
the name of the file to open.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<tt>Translhextion filename.dat</tt> opens the file called &quot;filename.dat&quot;<br>
<tt>Translhextion a file-name.dat</tt> opens the file called &quot;a file-name.dat&quot;<br>
<b>Note</b>: In the <a href="../10/10-Preferences.htm">Options/Preferences</A> menu you can choose to associate
Translhextion with a Windows Explorer Context menu and simply
right click to open files in Translhextion. Also, if you put a
link to Translhextion.exe into the &quot;SendTo&quot;-Folder in
your main Windows directory then you can open any file from the
Explorer with Translhextion by choosing Translhextion from the
&quot;Send To&quot;-item in the file's context menu.<br>
<br>
You can also choose <a href="03-Open.htm">File/Open</a> from the menu. If a file is already
loaded and it has been changed, then you will be prompted if you
want to lose the changes.<br>
<br>
A file can also be dragged (for instance from the Windows
Explorer window) into Translhextion's window to open it. If
several files were dragged, then only the first one will be
opened.</p>
