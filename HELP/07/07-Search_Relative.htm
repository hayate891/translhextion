<br>
In short, search for a find string relatively in a file. The
dialog allows you to choose whether you want to search for the
next instance in a specific direction. You may search for strings
containing the characters (A - Z), (a - z), and (1 - 9). Any
other character in the find string is treated as a byte-wildcard.
Please not this is only useful for finding strings using the
western alphabet (arabic alphabet).<br>
<br>
If I want to search for string but I don't have a table for the
file's text encoding then I have to search for it relatively.
This works only if the string does not make use of DTE. Please
note that the reason <a href="../02/02-DTE.html">DTE (Dual Tile Encoding)</A> is considered to be
a pain among table makers is because you cannot easily search for
strings relatively if they use DTE. <a href="../02/02-MTE.html">MTE (Multiple Tile Encoding)</A>
is hated even more. In addition, it must be noted that just
because a string was found in the file matching your search
string it does not necessarily mean that it IS in fact equal to
the search string. It just means that the found string's
characters are RELATED to each other in exactly the same way as
the search string's characters are RELATED to each other. <br>
<br>
This works best when there are at least 2 of each type of
character (I.E. if there is one lower case letter in the string,
adding a few more would work better. The same goes for upper case
&amp; for numbers)<br>

Example<br>
<TABLE>
<TR>
 <TD class="top">SEARCH FOR</TD>
 <TD class="top">POSSIBLE RESULTS</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>&quot;Chocobo&quot;</TD>
 <TD>&quot;Chocobo&quot;, &quot;Zhocobo&quot;,
&quot;4hocobo&quot;, &quot;Qipdpcp&quot;, etc.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>&quot;Cho*o*o&quot;</TD>
 <TD>&quot;Chocobo&quot;, &quot;Cho o o&quot;,
&quot;ChoZoZo&quot;, &quot;QipQpQp&quot;, etc.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>&quot;I am here&quot;</TD>
 <TD>&quot;I am here&quot;, &quot;ILamLhere&quot;,
&quot;Zeamqhere&quot;, &quot;QQbnQifsf&quot;, etc.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>&quot;uR8tE5&quot;</TD>
 <TD>&quot;uR8tE5&quot;, &quot;vS9uF6&quot;, etc.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<br>

<br>
You may wonder why you would get a result like &quot;Qipdpcp&quot;
when searching for &quot;Chocobo&quot;. The answer to this is
that the letters in &quot;Qipdpcp&quot; are related in the same
way as the letters in &quot;Chocobo&quot;. This illustrates why
relative search is not an exact science. The likelihood of
someone choosing to encode (or encoding by accident) &quot;Qipdpcp&quot;
AND &quot;Chocobo&quot; in the same file is not great but it is
something to be aware of. The shorter the search string and the
more common the letter combinations the more likely it is that
you're results will not be what you want.<br>
<br>
Technique Explanation:<br>
<br>
You may wish to read about <a href="../02/02-Text_Encoding.htm">&quot;Text Encoding&quot;</A> before you
read this.<br>
<br>
What relative search does is it will take a word you give it that
you know is going to<br>
appear somewhere in your file, and searches for words of the same
length whose characters are related in same way (by the same
offsets) as the characters in the search string. It searches by
assuming that if the letter A is for example entry $00, then B
must be entry $01, and so on. It uses the offset between each
character in a string as the comparison. For example, the
difference in the offset between A and B is almost always 1. So,
if we searched for &quot;ABBA&quot; then we would find all words
whose characters have offsets matching (1,0,1) as &quot;ABBA&quot;
does. This can turn up a number of inaccurate matches if a short
string with common letters is used.</p>
