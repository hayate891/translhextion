Hey Januschan. There are some things that you should know about this project, so I decided to make a list
of the stuff you should be aware of. Here goes:<P>
The text in the "Can you help?" section is adapted from the original help file. I added some
punctuation marks, made your requests in bold, and I made Necrosaro's explanation of Pointer Calculation in tele-type font,
so it would look cleaner.<BR> Just remember to remove the "I'd like to compile this help file as 
HTML Help..." message!<P>
I added myself to the "Acknowledgements" section. I reserved some space for you to add a comment :)<P>
"Byte-code Syntax": The examples are well placed, but I'd reccommend remaking the chart to your own liking.<P>
Some parts of "Thingy tables" were teletyped for easier reading.<P>
All of the charts used in the "Find using table" and "Replace using table" sections were converted to tables for easier reading and
placement/editing.<P><DIV CLASS="title">About the default_style.css file</DIV><P>
The default_style.css file controls the background, font size/style/color, and some special editing that was used for the tables and
the page titles. The body style is as follows:<P>
<tt>BODY{<BR>
font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, Helv;&nbsp;&nbsp; //just specify the new font here.<BR>
font-size:15px; &nbsp;&nbsp; //change this to your liking.<BR>
color:#ffffff; &nbsp;&nbsp; //This is the text's color, set to white.<BR>
background-image:url(nestenbg.gif); &nbsp;&nbsp; //Change this to another file to change the background.<BR>
// Just be sure to specify the new file and remove the old one in the "Files" section of the project,<BR>
// or else it won't compile!<BR>
background-color:#000000;} &nbsp;&nbsp; //This is the background color, set to black.<BR></tt><P>
div.italic = This is used in some places to make a bold italic font appear.
div.title = This is used in every page. It underlines and boldfaces the titles.
td = Sets the default size of the table's TD section, and uses a monospace font.
td.top = The title for the charts. It underlines and makes the letters 1 pixel bigger.<P>&nbsp;<P>
I guess that's it. Thank you for letting me be a part of this great project, even if it was in such a small way.<P>
Just one more thing. Your gratitude is pay enough for me... [though some money wouldn't hurt =D] Just kidding about the money bit.

<P><P>
Later!
