<p><DIV CLASS="title">Separated-byte Format</DIV><P>
I developed this format as a way of dumping a script leaving a
clear indication of how many bytes I had to work with during the
translation process. Basically, scripts dumped in this format
have single-byte <a href="02-DTE.html">DTE (Dual Tile Encoding)</A> and multiple-byte <a href="02-MTE.html">MTE (Multiple
Tile Encoding)</A> values enclosed in ' { ' and ' } ' which I call
byte-literals. <BR>
<b>NOTE</b>: ONLY CHARACTER PAIRS THAT ALREADY EXIST AS
DUAL-TILES IN THE EDITING FILE CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE AND
PLACED BETWEEN BRACKETS AS A BYTE-LITERAL. YOU CANNOT MAKE UP YOU'RE
OWN DTE VALUES WITHOUT DOING GRAPHICS AND/OR ASSEMBLY CODE EDITING. THE SAME HOLDS
TRUE FOR MTE VALUES.<br>
<br>
The output looks like this:<br>
<br>
<tt>C{re}w:Cap{ta}{in} {Cecil},<br>
{ w}{e }{ar}{e }ab{ou}t{ t}o{ a}rri{ve}!<br>
{Cecil}:G{oo}d.{END}</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>C{re}w:{Wh}y{ a}r{e }w{e }{ro}bb{in}g<br><!-- There was a mistake here. C{re}w was C{}w-->
{ c}{ry}{st}{al}{s }f{ro}m {in}{no}c{en}t<br>
{ p}eop{le}?<br>
C{re}w:T{ha}t'{s }{ou}{r }d{ut}y.<br>
C{re}w:Do{ w}{e }{re}{al}l{y }{ha}v{e }{to}<br>
k{ee}p{ d}o{in}g{ t}h{is}?{END}</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>C{re}w:Cap{ta}{in}!<br>
C{re}w:W{e }c{an}'{t }{st}{an}{d }do{in}g<br> <!-- Another typo: this said 'C{re}w:W{e }c{an}'{}{st}{an}{d }do{in}g' -->
{ t}h{is}{ a}nymo{re}!</tt><br>
<br>
Each byte is clearly identifiable. A character literal or newline
literal that is one byte is displayed normally, a DTE value is
displayed between brackets and represents one byte, an end block
literal is displayed between brackets, and multi-byte values like
&quot;Cecil&quot; in this case (which is 2-bytes) are also in
brackets. If the number of replacemement bytes is crucial, and it
often is, this format makes it easy to keep track of the number
of bytes you have to work with. If the text you are editing is
going to remain very similar to what it already is, this format
is best. This format is also faster to replace. <br>
<br>
When this format is not enabled the same output looks like this:<br>
<br>
<tt>Crew:Captain Cecil,<br>
we are about to arrive!<br> <!-- Edited: Used to say 'we a are about to arrive!' -->
Cecil:Good.{END}</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Crew:Why are we robbing<br>
crystals from innocent<br>
people?<br>
Crew:That's our duty.<br>
Crew:Do we really have to<br>
keep doing this?{END}</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Crew:Captain!<br>
Crew:We can't stand doing<br>
this anymore!</tt><br>
<br>
This format is easier to read but if it is replaced without using
the optimization feature (Script/Optimize Script...) then each
character literal will be one byte. Most often, that is not
desirable. As you can see, an end block literal is still
displayed between brackets. Any numerical values or unknown
values will also be displayed in brackets. If you are writing a
script which needs to occupy as few bytes as possible, it is best
to dump to this format, then write the script, and finally use
the optimization feature (<a href="../09/09-Optimize_Script.htm">Script/Optimize Script...</A>) to crunch the number of bytes down.</p>
