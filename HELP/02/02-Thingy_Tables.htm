Most of the following is an excerpt from the Thingy98 readme.
Comments are made regarding what is supported by Translhextion
and what is not. Such comments are written following a '//'<br>
<br>

<b>ABOUT THE .TBL FILES</b><br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
The TBL files are alot alike the Xlate and Hexpose table files,
but not<br>
the same. Hey, thingy tables are standard now. If you don't like
it, tough.<br>
You can make as many lines as you want, in this format:<br>
<br>
<tt>80=0<br>
9A= this<BR>
5F=ed<br>
30= t<br>
0400=Cecil<br></tt>
<br>
Ah, important part...there are some &quot;special&quot; values
that are common in some<br>
games, and some special modifiers to make your script dumps
special-like.<br>
<br>
<br>
<tt>*xx</tt> = Newline Value (you can have up to 2 i think) <br>
//only one at a time is supported, the hex can be up to three
bytes long if needed<br>
<br>
<tt>/xx</tt> = End String Value (you can have up to 2 i think)<br>
//only one at a time is supported, the hex can be up to three
bytes long if needed<br>
<br>
<tt>$xx=x</tt> = &quot;Linked&quot; values(?)<br>
<ol>Specifying $02=x then automatically displays the &lt;$xx&gt;
value of
x characters after it. So putting in $02=1 would display:
&lt;$02&gt;&lt;$xx&gt; where xx is the hex value of the next 1
char.</ol>
<BR>//an unlimited number of these is supported but the value must be
&lt;= 99<br>
<br>
<tt>!xx</tt> = Dakuten Value<br>
//only one at a time is supported, the hex can be up to three
bytes long if needed<br>
<br>
<tt>@xx</tt> = Handakuten Value<br>
//only one at a time is supported, the hex can be up to three
bytes long if needed<br>
<br>
<tt>&gt;</tt> = <ol>Tells script dumper to look for Dakuten/Handakuten value
AFTER<br>
the char it modifies, not before.<br>
i.e. to search for [wa&quot;taleølelk] normally would produce:<br>
[wa(t&quot;)ale(lø)elk].<br>
If you use the &gt; option in your TBL file, it would produce:<br>
[w(a&quot;)tal(eø)lelk].</ol><br>
//supported<br>
<br>
<tt>#</tt> = <ol>Doesn't print ANY &lt;$xx&gt; commands. Make your scripts
look clean!<br>
Taking out the &lt;END&gt;s are easy, just replace them with
blank in DOS Edit.<br></ol>
//supported, though it is unwise to try and replace a script
dumped in this mode<br>
<br>
^xx = Highlight Byte
<p>//this is a Translhextion extension of Thingy Table functionality<br>
//the specified byte will be displayed in the highlight color<br>
//an unlimited number of these is supported though only single bytes are allowed<br>
<br>
<b>BOOKMARKS</b><br>
Bookmarks are helpful when you want to save a ROM address so you
can go back to it later.<br>
You can make bookmarks by directly editing the table file.<br>
The bookmark will look like this:<br>
<br>
<tt>(80600h)Text Block 1</tt><br>
<br>
The number is the address, text is the description.<br>
<br>
//table bookmarks are loaded to the bookmarks menu automatically
when a table is loaded<br>
//any bookmarks added during program operation are saved to the
table file<br>
//any bookmarks removed during program operation are removed from
the table file<br>
<br>
<b>SCRIPT DUMPING</b><br>
If you are thinking of dumping something more than once, i would
suggest<br>
making a script dump bookmark.<br>
A script dump bookmark will look like this:<br>
<br>
<tt>[80600h-8D600h]Dialogue Block 1</tt><br>
<br>
the first number is the beginning, the second number is the end,
and the text<br>
is the name.<br>
<br>
//script dump bookmarks are loaded to the script menu
automatically when a table is loaded<br>
<br>
SCRIPT INSERTION<br>
Add a &quot;insert bookmark&quot; line to your .tbl file. Example:</p>
<P>
<tt>{80600h-FF4dump.txt}Dialogue Block 1<br>
^^^^^^ The address to insert the script to.<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^ The filename to get the script from.<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Description of the &quot;insert bookmark&quot;.</tt><br>
<br>
//insert bookmarks are NOT supported because you can make a
regular bookmark and insert<br>
//from there<br>
<br>
<b>Pointer calculations</b><br>
<br>
in addition to script insertions, you can insert updated pointer
tables as<br>
well. first, make your insert bookmark and have that all set up.
Next, you<br>
need to add another line in your table file that looks like this:<br>
<br>
<tt>&amp;CE804h-200h</tt><br>
<br>
Thingy includes support for two types of pointers: standard
pointers and<br>
relative pointers.<br>
<br>
For standard pointers:<br>
The first address is the beginning location of your table file.
The second<br>
address is the size of the header (For NES games this is 10h, for
SNES games<br>
this is 200h.)<br>
<br>
For relative pointers:<br>
Same as standard pointers except make the header size 0.<br>
<br>
//no part of this is supported because I don't understand it but
I'd love to implement it.<br>
