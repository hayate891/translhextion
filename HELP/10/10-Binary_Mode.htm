<br>
What kind of byte order to use: Either Little-endian, as used in
Intel-computers or Big-endian, used for example in computers with
a Motorola processor.<br>
The difference between these modes is thus: Consider a longword,
which is 4 bytes (named A to D) long.<br>
<br>
<i>Longword in processor register</i> = ABCD.<br>
The least significant bit, which has the value 1, is found in
byte &quot;D&quot;. In a processor register the longword is
ordered in this way. If this value is written to a position in
memory, then by Intel convention the longword is written in this
way, with the growing offsets to the right:<br>
<br>
<i>Longword in memory</i> = DCBA.<br>
That is, the bytes making up the longword are written in reverse
order as they are found in a processor register.<br>
<br>
This means that a file written by a Big-endian machine will
contain wrong longword and word values if read by a Little-endian
machine without conversion.</p>
