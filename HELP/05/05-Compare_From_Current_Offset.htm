If you need to compare two files then load one into Translhextion
and choose this command. You will first be prompted to choose the
file to compare with. Choose a file and then the OK button.
Comparison will occur from the current caret offset.<br>
If the chosen file matches the data in the loaded file from the
current offset, you will be prompted so. Otherwise you will get a
list of areas of difference to choose from. Areas of difference
are ranges of bytes which are different in the files. For example:<br>
<br>
<tt>File 1: 00 01 02 03 04 (loaded file)<br>
File 2: 00 ff ff 03 04<P></tt>
In this case you will get one area of difference 2 bytes in size
from offset 1 to 2. These offsets are measured relative to the
current caret position. When you choose an area of difference
then it will be selected and displayed in the main window.<P>
The <a href="05-Get_FPValue.htm">Offset/Get floating point value</A> command:<br>
This will show you the floating point values starting at the
current caret position.<P>
The <a href="../03/03-Properties.htm">File/Current File/Properties...</A> command:<br>

Choose this to get the filename, path and size of the current
file, and also the total number of lines of the hexdump.</p>
