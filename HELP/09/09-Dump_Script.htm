<br>
This command is used to dump bytes from the file, parse them
through a Thingy Table, and export them as a readable script.
These bytes can either be exported to the screen (dialog) or to a
file. In the dialog you can choose the start offset where the
dumping begins (the byte at that offset is the first to be dumped)
and how many bytes to dump (specify either the offset of the last
byte to dump or the number of bytes including the first byte to
be dump, and check the appropriate radio button).<br>
<br>
If the command is chosen without a selection, then the values in
the dialog will be set so that the byte at the current offset
will be cut.<br>
<br>
You have the option of dumping a script using <a href="../02/02-Separated-byte_Format.html">&quot;Separated-byte
Format&quot;</A> (If you read nothing else in this help file, go read
about this) or as vanilla text as desired. When replacing scripts,
it is important to check appropriately whether this format was
used or not on the script file to be replaced. If <a href="../02/02-Separated-byte_Format.html">Separated-byte
Format</A> was used, the same <b>left enclosure</b> &amp; <b>right enclosure</b>
characters that were used in the dumping of the script MUST be
specified (this can be done in Options/Preferences...).<br>
<br>
If your script has Dakuten or Handakuten characters in it a prompt will ask if
you would like to merge them with the characters they modify.&nbsp; This
procedure creates the script in the same way that Thingy does.&nbsp; Choosing
this method means the script will lose its punctuation if you attempt to
re-insert it without making changes to it.&nbsp; Choosing no to this option will
create a script that can be re-inserted but punctuation characters will be
separate from the characters they modify. <br>
<br>
If you chose to dump the script to the screen then another dialog
will appear allowing you to view, edit, and reinsert (optional)
the script. It should be noted that as of this release there is
no &quot;optimization&quot; of the script when it is reinserted
and so <a href="../02/02-DTE.html">DTE (Dual Tile Encoding)</A> is not used even where possible.
If you choose to reinsert a script from this dialog you will be
warned if the number of bytes to be reinserted is different from
the number dumped. Currently there is no &quot;true&quot;
insertion from this dialog, only overwriting so you can choose to
have excess bytes overwrite existing values or you can truncate
the inserted script.
