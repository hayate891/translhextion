<br>
To directly edit a the script within a file make sure you have a table file
loaded and that read-only mode is disabled.&nbsp; Place the cursor
on the byte where you'd like to start editing, use the &lt;INS&gt; button to
select the desired mode (either insert or overwrite), and press
&lt;ENTER&gt;.&nbsp; The Thingy IME window will appear.&nbsp; Start typing.&nbsp; Your keystrokes will be encoded using
the loaded table as you type.&nbsp; Every 100 bytes the IME window will update
the file with your string and return to the IME window to allow you to keep
typing.&nbsp; You can stop editing by pressing &lt;ENTER&gt; again (this will
update the file with whatever is in the edit-box and close the IME window).&nbsp;
If you accidentally open the IME window and don't want to edit the script just
press &lt;ENTER&gt; when the edit box is empty and the IME will close.&nbsp;
