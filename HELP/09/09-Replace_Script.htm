<br>
This command is used to replace a script in the form of bytes to
the current file. In the dialog you can choose the start offset
where the replacing begins (the byte at that offset is the first
to be replaced). You can also choose the offset where the
replacing should end or you can keep replacing until the end of
the script is reached.<br>
<br>
If the command is chosen without a selection, then the values in
the dialog will be set so that the byte at the current offset
will be replaced.<br>
<br>
You have the option of dumping a script using &quot;Separated-byte
Format&quot; (If you read nothing else in this help file, go read
about this) or as vanilla text as desired. When replacing scripts,
it is important to check appropriately whether this format was
used or not on the script file to be replaced. If <a href="../02/02-Separated-byte_Format.html">Separated-byte
Format</A> was used, the same left enclosure &amp; right enclosure
characters that were used in the dumping of the script MUST be
specified (this can be done in Options/Preferences...). <br>
<br>
You can also choose whether you want to pad remaining bytes in
the range specified with '00' if the script file has been
completely replaced before the end of the range has been reached.
<br>
<br>
Before replacing a script, you may want to use <a href="09-Optimize_Script.htm">&quot;Script/Optimize
Script...&quot;</A> to make the best use of your bytes. After this
function has been used, the script has the same property as if
you had dumped the script with <a href="../02/02-Separated-byte_Format.html">Separated-byte Format</A> enabled.</p>
