Program redistribution notes:

Please note that further distributions of the program must include the following:

1) - The Font (Januschan Jome Regular.ttf)
2) - The help file
3) - The original license, found in DOC\LICENSE.TXT in the source code zip distribution.

These terms have been set by Brian Bennewitz himself, and written here by Kitsune Sniper,
since these were not mentioned in any form in the license. However it is asked that these
simple requirements be met.
